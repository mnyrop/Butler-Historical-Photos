summary: '"''Students discuss one of the panels in Columbia University''s Bicentennial
  Exhibit entitled ''A Man''s Right to Knowledge and the Free Use Thereof.'' A funereal
  design surrounds a photograph showing the damaged front of the office of La Prensa,
  the opposition newspaper in Buenos Aires, Argentina, closed by order of Juan Peron,
  January 26, 1951. The quotation from John Locke reads: ''...if what (a man) holds
  be, as he gives out, well fenced with evidence, and he sees it to be true, what
  need he fear to put it to the proof?...He whose assent goes beyond his evidence
  owes this excess of his adherence only to prejudice, and does, in effect, own it....declaring
  thereby that it is not evidence he seeks but the quiet enjoyment of the opinion
  he is fond of...''''"'
