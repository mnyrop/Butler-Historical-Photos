_summary: "'While Columbia University guards were lunching early today [September
  25, 1936], a well-organized squad of vandals daubed this red curtain of paint on
  the university's new library.  Work was believed done either by painters' union
  or students sympathizing with Bob Burke expulsion.  Paint is stain that 'sticks.''"
