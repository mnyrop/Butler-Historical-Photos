summary: 'Enos M. Johnson (left) of Brooklyn, hands rare volume over to Dr. Richard
  H. Logsdon, associate director of the Columbia University Libraries. The book, entitled
  ''A System of Natural Philosophy,'' was drawn from the shelves of the old King''s
  College library in 1772 -- a dozen years before King''s College became Columbia.
  It was recently discovered by Mr. Johnston as he rummaged through the attic at the
  home of his aunt, Miss Susan Ruggles of Binghamton, N.Y.  The scholar who borrowed
  the book was Robert Harpur, one-time librarian of King''s College and tutor of Alexander
  Hamilton.  It was not regarded as ''overdue'' at the University library, which was
  fortunate in view of the fact that a considerable fine would have been in order.
  The fine, calculated at the rate of five cents per day, would have totaled $3,248.50.
  Dr. Logsdon expressed the Library''s gratitude for the return of the volume. ''The
  Library is especially happy to have this historic volume come back into its possession,''
  said Dr. Logsdon. ''We are most grateful to Mr. Johnston. The book, spanning virtually
  all of Columbia''s life through nearly two centuries of American history, will serves
  as an interesting item for exhibition in Columbia''s coming Bicentennial celebration
  in 1954.'' (from: press release attached to image)'
